## 👋 About Me

🌌 Hey there, fellow traveler! I’m **Ahmed Aaliyan** (`@aaliyanexe`), a passionate **Front-End Developer** navigating the vast universe of web technologies.  

✨ Currently mastering the essentials — **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — while preparing to launch into the stratosphere with:  
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling at warp speed  
- **TypeScript** — adding stellar type safety  
- **Zustand** & **React Query** — managing state and data like a pro  
- **React** — crafting interactive, out-of-this-world interfaces  

🚀 On a mission to create sleek, smooth, and scalable user experiences that are truly stellar. No rush to land jobs just yet — I’m here to learn, build, and orbit around new ideas at my own pace.  

## 🌌 Cosmic Vibes  

🛰️ Fun fact: When not coding in zero gravity, I’m either watching MMA bouts, cheering for football matches, or gazing at the stars and dreaming of the next frontier.
